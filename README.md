# ü©∫ Health Check Service

A Django-based health monitoring service that tracks the status of external endpoints and exposes metrics via a REST API.

---

## üöÄ Overview

This service provides a robust health checking system that monitors multiple external endpoints and exposes their status through a clean API interface. It's built with Django REST Framework for reliability and scalability.

---

## ‚ú® Features

- **Endpoint Monitoring**: Continuously checks the health of configured external services.
- **REST API**: Exposes health metrics via `/health/` endpoint with detailed status information.
- **Historical Data**: Maintains a history of health check results for analysis.
- **Admin Interface**: Django admin support for easy management of endpoints.
- **Configurable**: Easy to set up and customize for different environments.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/samobeng14Dev/health-check-service
cd health_check_service

---

## Intall dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Apply migration
python manage.py migrate

## Create a superuser account:
python manage.py createsuperuser

## Run development server
python manage.py runserver

---

##‚öôÔ∏è Configuration
Access the Swagger UI at http://localhost:8000/
## üîê Admin Access

To access the Django admin panel:
open python shell -- python manage.py shell

1. Run `python manage.py createsuperuser` and complete the steps
2. Visit `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/`
3. Log in with your credentials

## NB
Initially, both Swagger and the admin UI shows no results unless you manually trigger health checks via shell.
This is due to the view relying on previously saved results without automatically running fresh checks.

Run the code below to handle that: 
from health_check.services import check_all_active_endpoints
results = check_all_active_endpoints()
print(results)
